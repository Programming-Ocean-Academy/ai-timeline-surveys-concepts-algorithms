        "\n",
        "The **Related Work** corpus in *Raza et al. (2025)* spans three key chronological and conceptual phases:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Foundational Theory (2002–2009):**  \n",
        "   Establishes classical paradigms—content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, hybrid systems, and matrix factorization.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Deep and Neural Evolution (2017–2022):**  \n",
        "   Expands the RS landscape through deep learning, neural CF, graph neural networks, and reinforcement learning models.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Domain-Specific and LLM-Driven Advances (2020–2024):**  \n",
        "   Integrates healthcare, e-government, and generative AI contexts—emphasizing **multimodal**, **LLM-based**, and **ethically aligned** recommender systems.\n",

        "**Overall Insight:**  \n",
        "These studies together form the **intellectual lineage** underpinning *Raza et al. (2025)*.  \n",
        "They trace the discipline’s transformation from **matrix and hybrid models** to **graph-based**, **reinforcement**, and **LLM-integrated paradigms**, ultimately framing the modern vision of **explainable, adaptive, and domain-aware recommender systems**.\n"
