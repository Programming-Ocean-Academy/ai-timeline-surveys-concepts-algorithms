        "| **Core Objective** | Express universal truths or deterministic relationships through exact equations. | Estimate probabilistic relationships and describe uncertainty in observed data. | Learn complex, data-driven representations and relationships through adaptive optimization. |\n",
        "| **Nature of Relationship** | **Deterministic and explicitly defined** — relationships between variables are fixed and governed by exact equations or logical laws. | **Probabilistic and inferential** — relationships are modeled as likelihoods or conditional dependencies | Reflecting uncertainty, variability, and sampling noise. | **Adaptive and emergent** — relationships are *learned* through hierarchical transformations and gradient-based optimization, allowing nonlinear dependencies and contextual interactions to arise directly from data. |\n",
        "| **Mathematical Foundation** | Based on formal logic, calculus, and algebraic systems. | Grounded in probability theory, estimation, and hypothesis testing. | Built on linear algebra, calculus, and optimization theory via differentiable computation. |\n",
        "| **Assumptions** | Rigid — defined by axioms and deterministic structure. | Moderate — requires distributional assumptions (normality, independence, linearity). | Minimal — assumptions are implicit; relationships emerge from data. |\n",
        "| **Representation of Reality** | Abstract, symbolic, and formula-based; emphasizes analytical expressiveness. | Descriptive, parameter-based, and empirically driven; emphasizes uncertainty. | Hierarchical, representational, and contextual — latent embeddings capture semantic and structural meaning. |\n",
        "| **Model Construction** | Derived analytically from theoretical or physical laws. | Built from empirical data using estimation techniques (MLE, regression, inference). | Learned automatically from large-scale data via gradient-based optimization and backpropagation. |\n",
        "| **Learning Mechanism** | None — deductive reasoning; parameters are fixed by derivation. | Parameter estimation from observed samples through likelihood or Bayesian updating. | Iterative self-adjustment via gradient descent and differentiable loss minimization. |\n",
        "| **Type of Knowledge** | Prescriptive — explains what must logically hold true. | Descriptive & inferential — explains what is likely true given evidence. | Constructive & generative — discovers what can be represented, predicted, or synthesized. |\n",
        "| **Dependence on Data** | Minimal — theory-driven; independent of empirical variability. | Moderate — dependent on representative samples. | High — entirely data-driven; performance scales with data volume and diversity. |\n",
        "| **Handling of Complexity** | Limited — struggles beyond low-dimensional or linear systems. | Moderate — handles moderate-dimensional probabilistic and multivariate structures. | High — excels with nonlinear, high-dimensional, multimodal data and complex pattern hierarchies. |\n",
        "| **Interpretability** | Fully transparent and interpretable (symbolic and exact). | High — interpretable coefficients, confidence intervals, and p-values. | Low to moderate — requires interpretability frameworks (e.g., SHAP, LIME, saliency maps). |\n",
        "| **Adaptability / Scalability** | Fixed — once defined, not adaptive. | Limited — requires re-estimation with new data. | Dynamic — scalable and adaptive through retraining, transfer learning, and fine-tuning. |\n",
        "| **Error Treatment** | Deterministic residuals (exact deviation from ideal). | Probabilistic error modeling (variance, likelihood, confidence intervals). | Loss-based learning — minimizes prediction or reconstruction error through gradient optimization. |\n",
        "| **Optimization Strategy** | Analytical derivation or algebraic solution. | Statistical estimation (closed-form or iterative MLE). | Gradient-based optimization (SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.). |\n",
        "| **Generalization Capability** | None — limited to the specific equation or system defined. | Moderate — generalizes within known data distributions. | High — generalizes across unseen data through abstract representation learning. |\n",
        "| **Computational Demand** | Low — relies on analytical or symbolic computation. | Moderate — increases with sample size and parameter count. | High — requires parallelized computation on GPUs/TPUs. |\n",
        "| **Examples** | Newton’s Laws, Maxwell’s Equations, Navier–Stokes Equations, Euclidean Geometry. | Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Bayesian Inference, ARIMA. | CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, GANs, VAEs, Diffusion Models. |\n",
