        "## Abstract\n",
        "This survey provides a comprehensive and structured overview of **self-supervised learning (SSL)**, a paradigm in which models learn representations from **unlabeled data** by solving pretext tasks that generate supervisory signals automatically. The authors classify SSL methods, explain their theoretical motivations, present milestone algorithms, and synthesize applications across vision, language, speech, and scientific domains. The emphasis is placed on **visual SSL**, where contrastive learning, masked image modeling (MIM), and hybrid approaches have driven major progress. The survey concludes by outlining open challenges and future research directions.\n",

        "## Problems\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Dependence on Labeled Data\n",
        "Modern supervised learning relies on large annotated datasets, which are costly and domain-specific. Many fields (e.g., medicine, biology, user analytics) have abundant **unlabeled** data but very limited labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Weak Generalization and Robustness\n",
        "Supervised models often overfit, memorize spurious correlations, and show vulnerabilities such as adversarial sensitivity. They struggle to generalize beyond training distributions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 3. Fragmented Landscape of SSL\n",
        "The SSL literature grew rapidly after 2020, but prior surveys focused on specific families. There is no unified framework connecting **context-based**, **contrastive**, **generative**, and **hybrid** methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 4. Conceptual Ambiguity Across Paradigms\n",
        "Boundaries between pretext tasks, contrastive learning, and generative modeling are unclear; the community lacks a coherent theoretical map linking these paradigms.\n",

        "| **1. Heavy dependence on large labeled datasets in supervised learning** | Supervised approaches perform poorly in domains with scarce labels (e.g., medical imaging, user profiling). Annotation costs limit scalability, and models overfit small labeled datasets. | Introduces SSL as a framework that learns directly from large unlabeled corpora via pretext tasks. Provides a taxonomy of SSL algorithms capable of supplementing or replacing supervised pre-training. |\n",
        "| **2. Fragmented and outdated understanding of SSL methods** | Earlier surveys cover narrow slices of SSL and miss post-2020 advances (e.g., MAE, BEiT, MIM, hybrid models). Lacks a unified overview connecting all families of SSL methods. | Delivers a comprehensive synthesis of modern SSL, unifying context-based, contrastive, generative (MIM), and hybrid methods under a coherent taxonomy. |\n",
        "| **3. Lack of clarity about theoretical connections among SSL paradigms** | Confusion over conceptual relationships between contrastive learning, generative modeling, clustering, and pretext tasks limits principled model design. | Explains shared mathematical foundations, linking SSL to PCA, spectral clustering, mutual information maximization, invariance learning, and supervised objectives. |\n",
        "| **4. Overfitting in contrastive learning and poor scaling in generative methods** | Contrastive learning overfits in low-label regimes and depends heavily on augmentations; generative models scale poorly and fail to capture global structure. | Reviews hybrid contrastive–generative frameworks (iBOT, CMAE, RePre, RECON) and outlines design principles that balance local detail modeling with global semantic structure. |\n",
        "| **5. Inefficiency of naive transfer of NLP masking paradigms to vision** | Early vision masking approaches (e.g., ViT-B/16) lag behind supervised baselines; redundancy in images makes pixel-level reconstruction difficult. | Provides structured analysis of MIM variants (MAE, BEiT, SimMIM), categorizing them by reconstruction target (pixels, HOG, VQ tokens, multimodal teachers) to clarify why some strategies succeed. |\n",
        "| **6. Limited understanding of how SSL integrates with broader ML paradigms** | SSL is treated in isolation; lack of unified treatment prevents innovation across GANs, semi-supervised learning, multi-modal learning, multi-view setups, TTT, and RL. | Offers a systematic integration of SSL with GANs, semi-supervised learning, multi-modal frameworks (e.g., CLIP), 3D data, test-time training, and meta-learning, showing how SSL concepts extend across domains and modalities. |\n",
        "| **7. Insufficient benchmarking and interpretability of SSL models** | Downstream accuracy alone is insufficient to understand learned features; no standardized evaluation for feature interpretability or cross-task generalization. | Summarizes evaluation methodologies including probing tasks, network dissection, linear probing, transfer-learning metrics, and cross-benchmark assessment. |\n",
        "| **8. No clear articulation of research trends and open questions** | Lack of guidance on unresolved problems, scaling behaviors, or promising directions slows community progress. | Identifies main research trends (e.g., CL vs. MIM dominance, multi-modal expansion, unified SSL) and lists open questions involving scaling laws, masking strategies, robustness, and unified architectures. |\n",
