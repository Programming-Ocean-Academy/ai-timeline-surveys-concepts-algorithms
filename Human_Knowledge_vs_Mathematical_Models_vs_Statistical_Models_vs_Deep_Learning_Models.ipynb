        "|-------------|----------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|\n",
        "| **Core Source of Power** | Domain expertise, intuition, reasoning, and experience accumulated through cognition and culture. | Deductive logic, formal proofs, and deterministic equations grounded in axioms. | Probabilistic reasoning, inference from data, and model-based estimation of uncertainty. | Representation learning, large-scale optimization, and computation-driven discovery from data. |\n",
        "| **Nature of Relationship** | Conceptual and interpretive — relationships are reasoned, abstract, and symbolic. | **Deterministic and explicitly defined** — relationships between variables are fixed and governed by exact equations or logical laws (e.g., \\( y = f(x) \\) derived from physical or geometric principles). | **Probabilistic and inferential** — relationships are modeled as likelihoods or conditional dependencies (e.g., \\( P(Y|X) \\)), reflecting uncertainty, variability, and sampling noise. | **Emergent and hierarchical** — relationships are discovered through layered, data-driven transformations and differentiable learning. |\n",
        "| **Dependence on Human Input** | Complete — relies entirely on human conceptualization, rules, and experience. | High — human defines structure and governing equations. | Moderate — human defines model type, assumptions, and features. | Minimal — human defines architecture and objective; model autonomously learns features and relationships. |\n",
        "| **Scalability with Computation** | Limited — reasoning does not scale with hardware. | Moderate — symbolic computation scales linearly. | High — estimation improves with computation but saturates. | Extremely high — performance scales exponentially with data, compute, and model size (scaling laws). |\n",
        "| **Adaptability to Data Growth** | Slow — requires reinterpretation or retraining of experts. | Static — must be reformulated manually. | Moderate — can be retrained on new data. | Dynamic — adapts continuously via gradient-based optimization and transfer learning. |\n",
        "| **Learning Mechanism** | Cognitive and experiential learning; reflective and qualitative. | None — analytical deduction from axioms. | Parameter estimation via sampling and inference. | Gradient-based optimization and representation learning through supervised or self-supervised feedback. |\n",
        "| **Assumptions about the World** | Intuitive, symbolic, and anthropocentric. | Deterministic, rule-based, and idealized. | Stochastic, distribution-based, and uncertainty-driven. | Nonlinear, adaptive, and data-driven — assumes structure is discoverable through learning. |\n",
        "| **Handling of Complexity** | Moderate — bounded by cognitive abstraction. | Low to moderate — limited by analytical tractability. | Moderate — constrained by feature design and distributional assumptions. | Very high — captures nonlinear, multimodal, and high-dimensional dependencies. |\n",
        "| **Knowledge Representation** | Linguistic, conceptual, rule-based. | Symbolic and equation-based. | Numeric and parameterized (coefficients, likelihoods). | Distributed and latent (vectors, tensors, embeddings). |\n",
        "| **Interpretability** | Very high — explanations are language-based and human-interpretable. | Fully transparent — every term has explicit meaning. | High — interpretable parameters and confidence measures. | Low — internal representations are abstract; interpretability achieved post hoc. |\n",
        "| **Error and Uncertainty Treatment** | Judged qualitatively or heuristically. | Deterministic residuals — exact deviation from theoretical truth. | Explicit probabilistic modeling — variance, likelihood, and confidence intervals. | Implicit — learned via differentiable loss minimization; uncertainty captured through data distribution. |\n",
        "| **Optimization Strategy** | Cognitive reasoning, heuristics, and experience-based refinement. | Analytical derivation and closed-form solutions. | Iterative estimation (MLE, EM, Bayesian inference). | Stochastic gradient descent and large-scale distributed optimization. |\n",
        "| **Concept of Intelligence** | Reasoning, abstraction, creativity, and insight. | Logical consistency and formal derivation. | Inference and prediction under uncertainty. | Learning, adaptation, and emergent generalization. |\n",
        "| **Role of Computation** | Supplementary — supports cognitive processes. | Supportive — symbolic computation and algebraic manipulation. | Essential — enables sampling, inference, and parameter estimation. | Foundational — computation itself drives learning; scaling yields intelligence. |\n",
        "| **Dependence on Human Knowledge** | Absolute — handcrafted and encoded manually. | High — models mirror human theoretical reasoning. | Moderate — models rely on human-defined features and assumptions. | Minimal — models extract structure autonomously; guided by architecture and loss design. |\n",
        "| **Scalability and Evolution (Sutton’s Bitter Lesson)** | Constrained by human cognition and time. | Constrained by theoretical expressiveness. | Improves with compute but saturates with complexity. | Continually improves with more computation, data, and model capacity — epitomizing the **Bitter Lesson**. |\n",
